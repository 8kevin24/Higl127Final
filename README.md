By Kevin Zhu
## Introduction
This summer, Team USA’s basketball players and the women’s table tennis team formed a wholesome connection, supporting each other at games and practices during the Paris 2024 Olympics. However, this camaraderie was overshadowed by distasteful media coverage that highlighted stereotypes and cultural biases.

## Event Summary

### Background
At the 2024 Paris Olympics opening ceremony this year, Team USA Basketball and Team USA Women's Table Tennis met by chance. Crowded together on a freezing boat in the middle of the Seine wearing cheap dollar tree ponchos, Stephen Curry struck up a conversation with Lily Zhang, showing each other their sports pin collections. This blossomed into a wholesome intra-sport crossover, as Team USA Basketball began to show up to the table tennis matches and practice, with loud cheering and heckling, and vice versa. Friendly bantering involve trashtalk where each side claimed they could beat the other in their perspective sport was a field day for the media, and many clips of the two teams interacting with each other went viral.

However, the ping pong team are mostly young pretty Asian American women, and the basketball players are NBA superstars well known for their playboy lifestyles, two facts that the media connected together in an extremely distasteful manner. This wasn’t the only problematic sentiment expressed in the media- “table tennis isn’t a real sport”, “is it even Team USA if it’s all Chinese” etc. all display deep cultural problems in how the media perceives Asian Americans, African Americans, and women in this country as a whole. 

These sentiments are politically incorrect, and therefore not shown in official news sources concerning the events.(Funnily enough, many of the news articles themselves directly link the suspect social media posts with the problematic comments). To truly get an unfiltered version of these discriminatory sentiments, I conducted a data analysis on Instagram and Twitter posts related to these events. I determined which ones were about the Team USA Basketball x Table Tennis crossover by finding about 20 tags that correlated to this event, and filtering all posts that mentioned at least 5 of those 20 tags. I then performed a bag-of-words TFIDF analysis on these comments, and here are the words that have the highest average TFIDF score across all comments.

Here are actual examples of the problematic sentiments, with explanations of some of the terms:

ESPN or NBA has the full power to regulate and take down comments. The fact that they haven't means that they are turning a blind eye completely.

Stephen Curry, while he is arguably the greatest point guard of all time, is referred to this here because point guards traditionally dish out many "assists" and "set up" their teammates. The implication is that he is the one who "set up" Edwards with his new posse of girls. Rui Hachimara is the only mixed black-Japanese player in the NBA - a quite vulgar implication.

Stephen Curry is the teammate that introduced Anthony Edwards to the table tennis team. "Alley Oop" is a basketball term, where a player "sets up" another player for a dunk. The commenter is implying that Curry "set up" Anthony Edwards with these girls.

 "Game is game", a phrase used in modern slang to signify picking up women. It can either mean one does it through unconventional methods( eg. someone who brings a barrel of cheese to a date) or someone who pursues 'unconventional' women (someone not up to their standards). Needless to say, this is problematic and showcases many things wrong with American perception of both Asian American women and black men alike.

## Historical Context

### Women Athletes in Media: The First Women in American Sports as Walkers, Cyclists, and Ballplayers
> "Even when their feats were recognized, women athletes often received mixed treatment in the media, with positive achievements overshadowed by skepticism or outright ridicule, particularly when competing in traditionally male-dominated sports" (Park 731).

> "Professional cyclists such as Louise Armaindo engaged in demanding competitions, sometimes against male cyclists. Although ignored by more elevated publications, they usually received favorable treatment in the public press, which often highlighted their physical attractiveness alongside their athletic feats" (Park 739).

> "The female ‘walking mania’ offered entertainment, and for some observers opportunities for what they hoped would be a bit of voyeurism. Some of the pedestriennes were celebrated more for their attire and perceived femininity than their endurance feats" (Park 735).

> "The National Police Gazette, while complimenting female athletes like Hattie Stewart on their skill, simultaneously emphasized their physical appearance, describing them as ‘excellent specimens of physical development’ with little attention to their competitive achievements" (Park 740).

TLDR: Women in sports have traditionally been objectified. Oftentimes their performance and achievement in the sport is neglected and belittled, and female athletes are judged based on their appearance. Even in a sports setting, gender stereotypes involving femininity, attractiveness and submission are hard to overcome.

### Perceptions of Black Athletes: The Black Boxing Movement and Jordan's Status
> "But as Andrews has demonstrated, Jordan’s blackness is overdetermined and has also served to signify black transgressions, as when his gambling behavior became a subject of negative media presentation and his father’s murder led to speculation on connections with organized crime. In these images, Jordan is represented as the threatening black figure, as the negative fantasy figure of black deviance from white normality. Jordan’s physique, power, and dominance might also feed into the fear of black bodies" (Kellner  48).

> "Thus, Jordan overall became positioned in media culture as the "goodblack," especially against the aggressiveness and visual transgressions of teammate DennisRodman who with his bleached and undisciplined hair, ear-ring, fancy clothes, and regularlyrebellious behavior represented the "bad" black figure and would continue to do so during his brief 1999-2000 sojourn with the LA Lakers." (Kellner 49)

> "Race relations continued to deteriorate for blacks in general, even as individual black athletes were wined and dined by both whites and blacks" (Moore 69).

> "Jackson’s first major fight in America... barely registered in the black press. After Jackson knocked out McAuliffe, Fortune acknowledged the equality of intellectualism to physicality and their importance to racial, social, and political power. He noted that sports ‘have taken the place in public importance once occupied by the Senate, the lecture field, literature, and art’ and that ‘the greatest of all contemporary idols is the boss slugger’" (Moore 70).

> "Fortune thought Jackson’s championship status would give blacks a claim to physical manliness and prove black equality beyond athletics" (Moore 70).

TLDR: While black atheletes have generally been a positive effect on American perceptions of blacks in general, they have actually partially contributed to the problematic steroetypes of brawny strength, violence, and the  toxic "masculinity" that modern American praises so much.

## Comparison and Analysis

### Perceptions of Women: The Fetishization of Asian Women and "Ping Pong isn't a real sport"
Fetishization of Asian women (and conversely, emasculation of Asian men) has been a problem in how Americans percieve Asians. Combined with the already misogynistic attitudes towards women in sports, these Asian American female athletes have two negative stereotypes to break free of. 

Many of the top sentiments in our analysis are directly correlated with the table tennis team's attractiveness or the fact that they are Asian, or that the sport they play isn't "a real sport".

### Perceptions of African Americans: The Womanizing Brute and the Superior Athlete
The colonial perception of African men as primal brutes that possess overwhelming strength and are sexually dominant still persist today. To be specific, Anthony Edwards, although he endorses a playboy lifestyle, is commonly characterized as the one who is trying to "pick up" these Asian American women in these social media comments, displaying the internalized roles that these people either consciously or subconsciously assign to black men.

## Conclusion
Social media's reaction to the Team USA Basketball and Table Tennis crossover at the 2024 Paris Olympics sheds light on ongoing issues in media representation of athletes, particularly regarding race and gender. By examining these problematic sentiments in depth, we reveal the lingering stereotypes that many people still harbor in our so called "liberal" and "modern" society. These stereotypes are not new news; historical precedents for them can be found in Park, Moore's and Kellner's articles.
